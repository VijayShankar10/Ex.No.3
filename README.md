### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040178
### Aim: To write the prompts for these following prompt types and evaluate that using any one method 1. Straightforward Prompts, 2. Tabular Format Prompting 3.Preceding Question Prompting and 4. Missing Word Prompting

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Straightforward Prompts:
    - •	"Define photosynthesis in one sentence."
    - Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using sunlight energy.
      
    - 	"List three advantages of electric vehicles."
    ChatGPT said:
    Reduced pollution: Electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, helping lower air pollution.
    
    Lower running costs: Electricity is cheaper than petrol or diesel, reducing overall operating expenses.
    
    Energy efficiency: EVs convert more of the energy from the battery into motion compared to traditional engines
    

 3.	Tabular Format Prompting:
     •	"Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."
   	<img width="982" height="413" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bfb51e7-4b77-49a5-8cc3-deeb9f0d4f69" />

     •	"Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."
   	<img width="985" height="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0a302d9-73a8-47c3-a44e-3b3142654044" />

   	
3. Preceding Question Prompting:
    •	"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."
   ChatGPT said:

Climate change is a global concern because it leads to rising temperatures, melting ice caps, extreme weather events, and threats to ecosystems and human health. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, creating a “greenhouse effect” that causes global warming and disrupts climate balance.

 •	"How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms."
Vaccines work by training the body’s immune system to recognize and fight specific germs without causing the actual disease. During **immunization**, a weakened or inactive form of a pathogen (or its part) is introduced into the body, prompting the immune system to produce **antibodies**. Later, if the person is exposed to the real pathogen, these antibodies quickly respond and protect the body from infection.

5. Missing Word Prompting:
   •	"The capital of France is PARIS."
  •	"In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce GLUCOSE."


### Conclusion 


Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.




# Result: Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
